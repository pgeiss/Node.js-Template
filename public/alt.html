	<p>Looks like everything's working okay. Go ahead and remove these placeholder files (index.html, alt.html, /css/test.css) and place the files you want to use for your site (ie, be publicly accessible) in the folder called "public". It's a good idea to use a folder structure like the one here (/js, /css, /fonts) to better organize the files on your site. Don't worry, everything outside the public folder is only accessible by the server (and the server administrator).</p>
