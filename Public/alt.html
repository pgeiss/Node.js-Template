	<p>Excellent, it seems that's working properly. Remove these placeholder files and place the files you want to be publicly accessible in the folder called "public". It's a good idea to use a folder structure like the one here (/js, /css, /fonts) to better organize your site. Don't worry, everything outside the public folder is only accessible by the server (and the server administrator).</p>
